test project that uses a React (create-react-app) front end with an Express backend.

Project will be a REST API where the Express backend sends and receives information from the React frontend.

TypeScript is implemented on the Express server to write the CRUD functionality for working with a MongoDB instance. The MongoDB will also be accessed from the server using the Mongoose ORM.
